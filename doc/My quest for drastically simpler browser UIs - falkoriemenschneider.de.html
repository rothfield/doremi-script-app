	    <p>A web application built with significant amounts of JavaScript
		code running inside the browser is a viable UI technology choice. Even in a
		conservative environment, teams can today legitimately decide to
		ignore traditional Java web UI frameworks like JSF, Spring MVC,
		Wicket, Tapestry etc. in favor of purely JS based libraries like
		AngularJS, Ember or React which usually results in single-page
		applications (SPA)<sup><a href="#141204-fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>

	    <p class="tldr">TL;DR My <a href="https://github.com/friemen/zackzack">ClojureScript prototype</a> 
		starts to show how nice UI code in the browser can
		look like: declarative, no callbacks, and an emphasis
		on purity.</p>

	    <h3>The race</h3>
	    <p>As I see it, teams coming from Java that turn to JavaScript
		for a large part of the application will face the following
		challenges:</p>

	    <p>JS looks similar to Java, but it is actually different in many
		ways. Teams working with e.g. Java in the backend and JS in the
		frontend need to have both skills available, which is why a backend JS
		engine like Google V8 with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> 
		looks like an interesting option<sup><a href="#141204-fn2">2</a></sup> to
		reduce the technology stack.</p>

	    <p>JS as programming language is full of sharp edges and little
		flaws. <a href="https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read">ES6</a>,
		once approved and widely available, will be an
		improvement, but it's far too early to state that JS
		will become a top-notch language for "programming in
		the large".</p>

	    <p>JS had until very recently<sup><a href="#141204-fn3">3</a></sup> 
		no static type checker.  Developers used to static
		type checking will have to change their habits to not
		shoot in their own foot. I don't think that a static
		type checker is a must to write well-crafted software,
		however it's a very useful tool to have in your belt
		when things get complex.</p>

	    <p>Let's face it: despite its problems, JS is the dominating web
		programming language and is here to stay. So it's quite understandable
		that many programming language communities are in the race to make
		their technology appealing to web UI developers. There are for example
		CoffeeScript, Dart, Elm, GWT, PureScript, Scala.js, TypeScript and god
		knows what, and yes: there is ClojureScript. All technologies have in
		common that they treat JavaScript as compilation target.</p>


	    <h3>ClojureScripts architectural advantage</h3>
	    <p>One particular challenge when building UIs is not
		JavaScripts fault, but a problem almost all languages
		without an explicit support for asynchronity share:
		<a href="http://callbackhell.com/">callbacks in callbacks in callbacks</a>,
		coordinated by shared mutable state. Many developers
		seldom face this problem in its entirety because we
		can often afford to avoid asynchronity outside of rich
		clients. But the browser <i>is</i> essentially a rich client
		programming environment with event handlers, a visual
		component tree a.k.a DOM and a single event-loop which
		must not be blocked. You want to react upon user
		input? Use a callback! You need a response from a
		remote call?  Use a callback! You need to do some
		background calculation? Use a web worker and pass a
		callback!  The problem here is that your logic is
		fragmented into several pieces, each wrapped by a
		callback. This makes understanding presentation logic
		harder. One callback is no issue, many will likely
		become a burden.</p>

	    <p>With <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a> 
		Clojure offers a practical implementation<sup><a href="#141204-fn4">4</a></sup> of an approach called 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes">Communicating Sequential Processes</a>
		which can also be used in 
		<a href="http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/12/communicating-sequential-processes/">ClojureScript</a>.  
		There's a <a href="http://www.lispcast.com/core-async-browser-motivation">very nice introduction</a> 
		of core.async in the browser by Eric Normand. It
		allows you to eliminate callbacks almost completely, creating the
		illusion of a compact, sequentially executed process with local
		state. Combined with <a href="https://github.com/swannodette/om">Om</a>, 
		a wrapper for Facebooks <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> library,
		ClojureScript promises to enable a drastically simpler way to encode
		UI functionality.</p>

	    <p>In the last few weeks I have built an architectural UI prototype,
		addressing some of the most recurring problems in enterprisey
		forms-over-data UIs like databinding, input validation or remote
		communication. My goal was to see how much work is actually needed to
		make "drastically simpler" happen in this scenario.</p>

	    <p>This work is on-going and can be <a href="https://github.com/friemen/zackzack">followed on GitHub</a>,
		I keep a <a href="http://www.falkoriemenschneider.de/zackzack/">demo running on my website</a>.
		I'd like to point out three interesting results so far:</p>


	    <h3>Concise specification</h3>
	    <p>You can concisely specify the static looks of the UI,
		for example like so:</p>
	    <div class="syntax"><pre>
(<span class="nf">panel</span> <span class="s">"fields"</span> <span class="nv">:layout</span> <span class="nv">:two-columns</span>
                <span class="nv">:elements</span> <span class="p">[(</span><span class="nf">checkbox</span> <span class="s">"private"</span><span class="p">)</span>
                           <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">textfield</span> <span class="s">"name"</span> <span class="nv">:label</span> <span class="s">"Full name"</span><span class="p">)</span>
                           <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">textfield</span> <span class="s">"company"</span><span class="p">)</span>
                           <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">textfield</span> <span class="s">"street"</span><span class="p">)</span>
                           <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">selectbox</span> <span class="s">"city"</span><span class="p">)</span>
                           <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">datepicker</span> <span class="s">"birthday"</span><span class="p">)])</span>	    
</pre></div>
            
	    <p>What you can see above are merely some nested function calls that
		eventually produce a data structure that is passed down to Om
		components. If you're able to assemble your UI out of simple
		components like those then such an approach is applicable and yields a
		textual specification of the UI.</p>


	    <h3>No callbacks</h3>
	    <p>You can get away without callbacks. Please take a look at
		the following piece of code which implements the reload action.</p>
	    <div class="syntax"><pre>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">defn </span><span class="nv">&lt;addressbook-reload</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">state</span> <span class="nv">event</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">go</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">= </span><span class="nv">:ok</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">&lt;!</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">&lt;ask</span> <span class="s">"You will loose all your local changes. Are you sure?"</span><span class="p">)))</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let </span><span class="p">[{</span><span class="nv">s</span> <span class="nv">:status</span> <span class="nv">addresses</span> <span class="nv">:body</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">&lt;!</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">http/get</span> <span class="s">"/addresses"</span><span class="p">))]</span>
          <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">= </span><span class="mi">200</span> <span class="nv">s</span><span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">assoc-in</span> <span class="nv">state</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">:addresses</span> <span class="nv">:items</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="nv">addresses</span><span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">Message</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="s">"Error loading addresses"</span><span class="p">)))</span>
        <span class="nv">state</span><span class="p">)))</span>
	    </pre></div>
	    <p>Its intention is:</p> 

	    <p><i>First, the user is asked for confirmation. If ok, a GET
		request is issued and, in case of success, the result is merged into
		the UI state.</i></p>

	    <p>You can test it in the Addressbook part of the running
		<a href="http://www.falkoriemenschneider.de/zackzack/">demo</a>.
		For those unfamiliar with core.async I'll try to explain
		what's going on here:</p>
	    
	    <p>The body of <code>&lt;addressbook-reload</code><sup><a href="#141204-fn5">5</a></sup> is
		wrapped in a go-block, which makes it a lightweight
		process that may pause when it accesses a channel. The
		immediate result of a go block is always an ad-hoc
		channel, that will eventually transmit the result of
		the body evaluation. The <code>&lt;!</code> operation is a blocking read. 
		A process reading from a channel is parked as long as there is no value available.</p>

	    <p>So the body inside <code>&lt;addressbook-reload</code> 
		first calls <code>&lt;ask</code> which starts its own
		process and immediately returns a channel that will
		transmit the users response. The <code>&lt;ask</code> process
		changes application state to show the question to the
		user. Then it reads from a channel that an event
		handler will put the users response on. Now, both
		processes are parked at <code>&lt;!</code>: 
		<code>&lt;ask</code> is waiting for the user,
		<code>&lt;addressbook-reload</code> is waiting for 
		<code>&lt;ask</code>.
		Once the response is available it is compared to the value <code>:ok</code>.
		If the user has confirmed to reload addresses from the
		backend the process issues a HTTP GET request, which
		again starts its own process, and does a blocking read
		with <code>&lt;!</code>, and again the process 
		<code>&lt;addressbook-reload</code> is parked until a value is
		available. Finally, if the returned status is 200, the response
		contains addresses which are merged into the application state.</p>

	    <p>While all this might sound complicated at first, it
		allows us to write code that is as close to our
		intention as it can get.  We just call ordinary
		functions and maintain full control of the flow of
		logic in one place.</p>


	    <h3>Pure functions</h3>
	    <p>If you scan the 
		<a href="https://github.com/friemen/zackzack#example">example code</a>
		you can see that much of the behavior is expressed with <i>pure</i>
		functions. Functions without side-effects and any
		dependence on a global context are the simplest
		building blocks that we can have in an application, so
		we prefer to build as much as possible in this
		way. Presuming each piece of UI renders and maintains
		a piece of state, you can express presentation logic
		by event-wise application of pure functions of the
		form <code>[state event -&gt; state]</code>. The pair Om+React is then
		the perfect tool to transform the updated state to a
		sequence of efficient DOM changes which we don't have
		to care about.</p>

	    <p>Despite the general preference for purity there are currently
		two exceptions to this:</p>
	    <ul><li>When two components need to interact, the functions
		involved cause side-effects by explicitly putting values into
		each others channel.</li>
		<li>Some functions start a lightweight process via go and
		    return a channel, because they rely themselves on
		    channel-returning functions. While it is debatable if using
		    go makes them impure, testing them may require us to use
		    <code>with-redefs</code> in order to temporarily
		    replace the functions that return channels.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>Anyway, most of the logic like validation constraints, most
		actions, rules and the specification of the view can be
		expressed with pure functions that make automated testing of
		presentation logic a breeze.</p>


	    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
	    <p>It's clear that the style of UI programming as shown in
		this prototype is rigid, so I expect that a project
		team has to do its own exercise to come to
		abstractions that suit its needs. However, I'm
		confident that it is in general possible to reach such
		level of clarity for any type of frontend. I spent
		only about 10 working days on it, and with respect to
		what I wanted to reach I'm quite satisfied with the
		combination of ClojureScript, core.async and Om in the
		browser. ClojureScript has become a very appealing
		option that fulfills my hope for "drastically simpler"
		UIs.</p>
