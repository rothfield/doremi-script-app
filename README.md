This is a front end for the [http://github.com/rothfield/doremi-script] project. It is wrtten using the following tools:
* Clojurescript
* Instaparse
* Twitter bootstrap
* html5
* html5 manifest(works offline!)
* html5 audio tag

I put effort to speed up the user experience guided by Google's page speed tool. The build.sh automizes this by minifying the css. I also add async to the script tag to speed page load.
